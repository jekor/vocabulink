-- The article file path is not strictly necessary to store, but it does allow
-- an article to have a different representation on the filesystem than some
-- translation of its title. This avoids potential problems with automatic
-- title-to-path translation, such as characters that the filesystem doesn't
-- like or articles with very long titles. The filepath however is just the
-- relative filename in the articles directory, not an absolute path.
